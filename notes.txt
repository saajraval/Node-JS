all the js files in Node are known as modules 
npm is tool used to install libraries 
eg : npm install validator


every json file has dependencies entry in it 
remove cap from the version to fix the version excatly 
^ mean any version will be installed 

eg: "dependencies": {
    "validator": "^13.7.0"
  } 

then we can remove cap for downoding the same version in it 

there are three types of modules : 
eg with types 
const validator = require("validator") -> external module

let calc =require("./calc") -> user defined module

const fs = require("fs"); -> inbuilt module 

Q:howw can we create a backend logic for any frontend 
ans => REST Api

API -> will respone to the request ...........and it is made in backend 
(it a URL in vage language )

in API input and output are in json 
all prog lang knows what json is and they will take i/p and o/p in the form of json 

REST is a protocol for API  

rules for 
1-> i/p and o/p in the format of json 
2-> to create mapping should be POST
3-> to read  mapping should be GET
4-> to remove mapping should be DELETE
5-> to update mapping should be PUT


REST VS SOAP 
XML VS JSON

-----------------------------------------------


add(5,5,function (ans)){
	return ans*ans
}

=> function here is called anonomous function 

or else we can use cllback function
